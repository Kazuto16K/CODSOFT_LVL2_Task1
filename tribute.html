                Subhas Chandra Bose (born c. January 23, 1897, Cuttack, Orissa [now Odisha], India—died August 18, 1945, 
                Taipei, Taiwan?) was an Indian revolutionary prominent in the independence movement against British rule of India. 
                He also led an Indian national force from abroad against the Western powers during World War II. 
                He was a contemporary of Mohandas K. Gandhi, at times an ally and at other times an adversary. 
                Bose was known in particular for his militant approach to independence and for his push for socialist policies.</div>

                    Subhas Chandra Bose was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Orissa, in British India, 
                    into a wealthy and prominent Bengali family. His father, Janakinath Bose, was a successful lawyer, 
                    and his mother, Prabhavati Devi, was known for her piety. Bose was a brilliant student, excelling in 
                    academics and graduating from the University of Calcutta. Influenced by the nationalist movement, he later 
                    went to England to prepare for the Indian Civil Services (ICS) examination, which he passed with distinction 
                    in 1920. However, he resigned from the ICS in 1921 to fully commit to India's struggle for independence.</div>

                    Upon his return to India, Subhas Chandra Bose immersed himself in the nationalist movement, 
                    working closely with key leaders like Chittaranjan Das, who became his political mentor. 
                    From 1921 to 1925, Bose was actively involved in the Indian National Congress and faced multiple arrests 
                    for his nationalist activities. In 1930, even while imprisoned, he was elected Mayor of Calcutta, 
                    reflecting his growing influence and popularity. His leadership qualities and vision for India's independence 
                    culminated in his election as President of the Indian National Congress at the Haripura Session in 1938. 
                    Re-elected in 1939 at the Tripuri Session, Bose resigned shortly thereafter due to ideological differences 
                    with Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress high command, particularly over the approach to achieving complete 
                    independence.</div>

                    Following his resignation from the Congress presidency, Subhas Chandra Bose founded the 
                    Forward Bloc within the Congress in 1939, aiming to consolidate the political left. His radical 
                    approach led to frequent conflicts with British authorities, resulting in his house arrest. In a 
                    daring escape in 1941, Bose fled India, traveling through Afghanistan and the Soviet Union to reach Germany. 
                    In Germany, he sought support for India's independence from the Axis powers. By 1943, Bose had moved to Japan, 
                    where he assumed leadership of the Indian National Army (INA), comprised mainly of Indian prisoners of war and 
                    expatriates. Under his command, the INA fought alongside Japanese forces in campaigns against British troops in 
                    India, particularly in the battles of Imphal and Kohima in 1944.</div>

                    The INA's efforts, although ultimately unsuccessful in the military sense, significantly 
                    boosted the morale of Indian nationalists. In 1945, Subhas Chandra Bose was reported to have died in a 
                    plane crash in Taiwan on August 18, although the exact circumstances and evidence of his death remain a 
                    subject of controversy and speculation. Despite his contentious relationship with other Indian leaders and 
                    the controversial alliances he forged, Bose's unwavering commitment to India's independence and his charismatic 
                    leadership left an indelible mark on the freedom movement. His legacy continues to inspire generations in India 
                    and beyond, symbolizing the relentless quest for sovereignty and justice.</div>
